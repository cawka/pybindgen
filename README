PyBindGen is (surprise!) a python bindings generator.  The main features are:

 * Is written in clean, PEP 8 compliant, and pylint checked, Python code;

 * Generates clean C or C++ code, nearly as readable as code written
manually by a developer;

 * Generated code does not require any external libraries or macros;

 * Does not require Boost.Python (no C++ template magic, also works in C);

 * The main interface for code generation is a simple Python API, not
some obscure interface definition language.  Other frontends, such as
parsing header files with gccxml, are easy to add as an additional
layer;

 * Can be easily extended with new type handlers;

 * Type handlers can allocate memory and register cleanup code to free;

 * Supports in, out, and inout parameters (e.g. with pointers or C++ references);

 * Supports multiple return values (e.g. due to out/inout parameters);

 * Supports wrapping of simple C++ classes;

Planned:

 * Support virtual methods in classes;

 * Support reference counted classes;

 * Callbacks;
